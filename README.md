This repository contains resources for a Yale Daily News analysis of the Class of 2020. The associated story, titled *Yale class of 2020: By the numbers*, can be found [here](https://yaledailynews.com/commencement2020/2020/05/15/yale-class-of-2020-by-the-numbers/).

Ashley Qin and Daniel Kim, data analysts for the News, analyzed the data, extracted key data insights, and wrote a majority of the story.

## Data and Processing
We obtained the data from a survey we sent out to the Class of 2020 consisting of 18 post-graduate-related questions (google doc with questions asked can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WeCXNHqUoPbkZAsoHZqtk6StX4t-Fxv2gp5JJ_zdeDA/edit?usp=sharing)). Out of 1,386 seniors, 337 responded--a response rate of 24.2%.

`YDN Senior Survey.csv` is the raw dataset, which you are free to use for your own exploration.

## Visualization
Tableau was used to create visualizations for the data.
